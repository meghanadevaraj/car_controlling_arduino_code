The Trash Collection Robot on Water Bodies is a manually operated Arduino-based project designed to collect floating waste from lakes, rivers, and other water bodies. It uses a simple car controller system powered by an Arduino microcontroller, allowing the user to control its movement remotely. The robot navigates the water using DC motors and is equipped with a net or collection mechanism to gather floating trash. By providing an easy-to-use and efficient solution, this project helps reduce water pollution and protect aquatic ecosystems.
