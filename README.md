To design and develop a manually controlled floating robot capable of collecting floating waste from water bodies, improving water quality, and reducing pollution

The IoT-powered trash collection robot offers an innovative solution to marine pollution, a critical global issue impacting ecosystems, economies, and societies. Oceans face threats from plastics, chemicals, and oil spills due to industrialization and mass consumption. This robot uses a network and connected devices for efficient waste collection and sorting, aligning with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Operable via Arduino Bluetooth controller App -enabled Android phone, the robot can be controlled globally through the internet, advancing waste management and environmental stewardship.
